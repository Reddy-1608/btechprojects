OpenCV Contrib (opencv-contrib-python)
Command: pip install opencv-contrib-python
Why:
Provides core OpenCV functions: image/video reading, processing, display.
Includes cv2.face module for LBPH Face Recognizer (needed for face recognition).
Regular opencv-python does not include face recognition modules.

NumPy (numpy)
Command: pip install numpy
Why:
Stores labels and image data as arrays for training.
Handles numerical operations and matrix manipulations efficiently.
Required for LBPH face recognizer to process images.

os (built-in Python module)
Command: None (comes with Python)
Why:
Handles file paths and checks if image files exist.
Useful for managing reference images and datasets.
Optional Verification

Command:
import cv2, numpy as np, os
print(cv2.__version__)
print(np.__version__)
print(os.name)
print(dir(cv2.face))  # Should list LBPHFaceRecognizer_create

Why:
Confirms that OpenCV, NumPy, and os are installed correctly.
Ensures the face recognition module is accessible.
