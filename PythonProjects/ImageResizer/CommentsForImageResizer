Import PIL (Pillow) library
from PIL import Image
Why: Provides image processing functions like opening, resizing, and saving images.
Installation: If not installed, run: pip install pillow.

Open the image
image_path = "OIP.jpeg"
img = Image.open(image_path)

Loads the JPEG image from the given path.
Returns a PIL.Image.Image object.

Display original image size
print(f"Original size: {img.size}")

img.size returns a tuple (width, height).
Helps to know the current dimensions before resizing.

Define new size for resizing
new_width = 400
new_height = 400
new_size = (new_width, new_height)
Sets target dimensions for the resized image.
Can be adjusted according to your needs.

Resize the image
resized_img = img.resize(new_size)
Creates a new image object with the defined size.
Maintains aspect ratio only if manually calculated; otherwise, it stretches to the new size.

Save the resized image in PNG format
png_image_path = "resized_image.png"
resized_img.save(png_image_path, "PNG")
Converts and saves the image as a PNG file.
Ensures compatibility and potentially lossless compression.

Print confirmation
print(f"Resized image saved as '{png_image_path}' (in PNG format)")
Confirms that the image was successfully resized and saved.

Summary
Library: Pillow (PIL) → install via pip install pillow.
Functions used: Image.open(), img.size, img.resize(), img.save().
Purpose: Open a JPEG image, resize it to a defined size, and save it as PNG.
