Import PyPDF2 library
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger
Why: Provides functions to read, merge, split, and manipulate PDF files.
Installation: If not installed, run: pip install PyPDF2.

Create an instance of PdfMerger
merger = PdfMerger()
Initializes a merger object to combine multiple PDFs into one.

List PDF files to merge
pdf_files = ['basic-text.pdf', 'fillable-form.pdf']
A Python list containing the paths or names of PDF files.
Order in the list determines the order in the merged PDF.

Append each PDF to the merger
for pdf in pdf_files:
    merger.append(pdf)
Loops through each PDF file in the list.
Appends each PDF sequentially to the merger object.

Write the merged PDF to a new file
output_pdf = 'merged_output.pdf'
merger.write(output_pdf)
Combines all appended PDFs into a single PDF file.
Saves it with the specified output file name.

Close the PdfMerger object
merger.close()
Frees resources and closes the merger object to avoid memory leaks.

Print success message
print(f"The PDFs have been successfully merged into '{output_pdf}'")
Confirms that the merging process is complete.
