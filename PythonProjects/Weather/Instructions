Import json library
Converts JSON responses from the API into Python dictionaries.
Why: Makes it easy to access temperature, humidity, wind, etc.

Import requests library
Sends HTTP requests to access the weather API.
Why: Needed to fetch live weather data from the internet.
Installation: pip install requests

Import speak from pyttsx3
Converts text to speech so the program can speak the weather.
Installation: pip install pyttsx3

Ask the user for a city name
city = input("enter the city name: ")
Takes input to fetch weather data for the specified location.

Create API URL
url = f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={city}"
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your WeatherAPI key.

Prepares the URL with the city query.
Send a GET request to the API
x = requests.get(url)
Fetches data from the weather API for the requested city.

Convert JSON response to Python dictionary
wdic = json.loads(x.text)
Allows easy access to weather details like temperature, humidity, etc.

Extract temperature in Celsius
y = wdic["current"]["temp_c"]
print(wdic["current"]["temp_c"])
Stores the temperature for speaking and prints it to the console.

Speak the temperature
speak(f"the temperature in {city} is {y} degrees")
Uses pyttsx3 to read out the temperature in a human voice.

Summary
Libraries used: json (parse data), requests (get API data), pyttsx3 (text-to-speech).
Purpose: Fetch live weather information and announce it.
Input: City name from the user.

Output: Temperature printed on console and spoken aloud.
